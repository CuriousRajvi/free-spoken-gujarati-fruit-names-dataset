<h1>Spoken Fruits Dataset in Gujarati Language</h1>
Rich Collection of Spoken Gujarati Fruit Names for Dialect Classification. Similar to the Fruits 360 Dataset for Audio.

<h1>Abstract: </h1>
<p>The rapid growth of audio-based content, particularly in regional languages, necessitates the development of efficient retrieval systems to facilitate effec-tive access to audio resources. This paper presents an audio-based content retrieval system focused on the classification and retrieval of Gujarati fruit names. The system aims to classify the spoken fruit names based on dialect, specifically from five different regions, namely North region, Saurashtra re-gion, Baroda region, Kutchi region, South Region, thus enabling accurate identification of the region to which an audio sample belongs. The systemâ€™s implementation involves manually collecting a dataset of audio samples in practical environments, capturing variations in pronunciation and accents across different regions. By analyzing these audio samples, the system aims to identify distinctive dialect patterns and classify them accordingly. This re-search is motivated by the need to explore and expand speech recognition technologies in Gujarati, as there is ample scope for advancements in this domain. The proposed system serves as an application of audio-based con-tent retrieval in the context of Gujarati language and dialect classification. By leveraging the potential of speech recognition techniques, this system opens up opportunities for further research and applications in various fields. The outcomes of this study contribute to enhancing information retrieval systems for regional languages, addressing the growing demand for audio-based con-tent access and analysis.</p>

<h1>Naming Convention:</h1>
Files are named in the following format:<br/>
{region_number}{speaker_number}{trial_number}-{fruit_number}.wav<br/>
Example: r1s1t1-01.wav Here r1 suggests region 1, s1 suggests speaker 1 from that region, t1 suggests trial 1, and 01 suggests fruit 1(chiku).<br/>
